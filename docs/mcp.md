# Cavalheiro Experience MCP Server

## Overview

Cavalheiro Experience exposes a **remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that gives AI assistants and developer tools direct, authenticated access to your CRM data. Clients can search deals, manage contacts, send messages, review AI-suggested stage advances (HITL), and more — all via standardized MCP tool calls.

The server is built on [`mcp-handler`](https://github.com/vercel/mcp-handler) and runs as a Next.js route at `/api/[transport]`, supporting both the Streamable HTTP and SSE transports defined in MCP 2025-03-26.

---

## Endpoint

| Transport | URL | Use case |
|-----------|-----|----------|
| Streamable HTTP | `/api/mcp` | Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, most modern clients |
| SSE (legacy) | `/api/sse` | Clients that only support the older SSE transport |

Both transports share the same tool registry and authentication logic.

---

## Authentication

Every request must carry a valid Cavalheiro Experience API key. Two header formats are accepted:

```
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```
```
X-Api-Key: <API_KEY>
```

API keys are created in **Cavalheiro Experience → Settings → API Keys**. Each key is scoped to a single organization; all tool calls are automatically filtered to that organization's data.

Unauthenticated requests receive an MCP-level auth error and no tool output.

> **Security note:** API keys are validated via the `validate_api_key` Supabase RPC. The server resolves `organization_id` and `user_id` from the key and stores them in `AsyncLocalStorage` for the duration of the request. Keys are never echoed back in any tool response.

---

## Connecting Clients

### Claude Code

Add to `.mcp.json` in your project root (or `~/.claude/mcp.json` for global config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nossocrm": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For production, replace the URL with your deployed domain.

### Cursor / Windsurf

Use the same JSON structure above in your MCP settings panel (the exact UI location varies by IDE version). Both support the Streamable HTTP transport.

### MCP Inspector

1. Open MCP Inspector.
2. Set **Transport Type** to `HTTP`.
3. Set **URL** to `https://<your-domain>/api/mcp`.
4. Set **Bearer Token** to your API key.
5. Connect, then run `tools/list` to verify.

### stdio-only clients

Use `mcp-remote` as a bridge:

```bash
npx -y mcp-remote http://localhost:3000/api/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

> **Note:** The `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` header is required for Streamable HTTP transport. Without it, some intermediaries may reject the response.

## Architecture

- **Framework:** Next.js App Router route at `app/api/[transport]/route.ts`, handling both `/api/mcp` (Streamable HTTP) and `/api/sse` (SSE) via a single `[transport]` dynamic segment.
- **MCP library:** [`mcp-handler`](https://github.com/vercel/mcp-handler) — provides `createMcpHandler` and `withMcpAuth` wrappers optimized for Vercel serverless functions (`maxDuration: 120s`).
- **Tool registration:** Five registration functions are composed at server startup:
  - `registerExistingCrmTools` — deals, contacts (basic), activities, notes, stages, pipeline
  - `registerMessagingTools` — channels, conversations, messages, templates
  - `registerAITools` — HITL, briefings, patterns, metrics
  - `registerAdminTools` — users, AI settings
  - `registerContactsAdvancedTools` — dedup, merge, export, import
- **Database access:** All tools use `createStaticAdminClient()` — a Supabase service-role client that bypasses RLS. Organization scoping is enforced explicitly in every query via `.eq('organization_id', ctx.organizationId)`.
- **Request context:** `organizationId` and `userId` are resolved from the API key during auth and stored in `AsyncLocalStorage` (`mcpContextStorage`). Tools retrieve context via `getMcpContext()` without needing to pass it through function arguments.
- **Auth flow:** `withMcpAuth` calls `resolveApiKey(token)`, which delegates to `authPublicApi` (the same validator used by the REST public API), then fetches the `created_by` user from `api_keys` to populate `userId`.

---

## Security

- **API keys** are validated server-side on every request; the raw key value is never included in tool responses or logs.
- **Channel credentials** (WhatsApp tokens, email API keys, etc.) are explicitly excluded from all `crm.channels.list` queries — the `settings` column is returned but credential fields are not selected.
- **AI provider keys** (`ai_google_key`, `ai_openai_key`, `ai_anthropic_key`) are stripped from `crm.settings.ai.get` output; only boolean presence flags are returned.
- **Organization isolation:** Every query is scoped by `organization_id`. There is no cross-org data access path.
- **Write tools** verify resource ownership before mutating — e.g., `crm.messages.send` confirms the target conversation belongs to the caller's org before inserting.
- **Template sync** (`crm.templates.sync`) is intentionally blocked at the MCP layer — it always returns an error directing users to the web UI, because it requires live Meta API credentials that are not safe to expose through this interface.
- **HITL resolution** records `resolved_by` (the `userId` from the API key) and `resolved_at` for audit purposes.
